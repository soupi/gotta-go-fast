# What makes programs go fast?

In this chapter we'll explore how Haskell behaves under the hood.

We'll take a look at Haskell's evaluation semantics,
laziness/strictness and how to control it, how to represent
data wrt performance, allocation and its affect on performance,
how various GHC affect performance, and more.
