# About this book

This book is a community-driven effort to provide a document describing
how to write _idiomatically fast Haskell_ by providing insight into how
Haskell behaves under the hood, describing various techniques and tools
used to identify performance issues, categorizing common performance
issues, and demonstrate how to tackle performance problems step-by-step
using case studies.
